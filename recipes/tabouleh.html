   <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>olive oil</li>
     <li>lemon juice</li>
     <li>parsley</li>
     <li>tomatoes</li>
     <li>green onions</li>
     <li>bulgur</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps :</h2>
   <ol>

     <li>I like to start making the tabouleh by mixing the dressing. It’s made up of two ingredients: olive oil and lemon juice – easy enough! I whisk those together until well blended, and then let the flavor settle while I chop the vegetables.</li>

     <li>One important tip I learned though from my mother-in-law is to add the bulgur to the dressing while preparing the vegetables. This allows the bulgur to absorb some of the liquid and soften – making it easier to chew it in the salad. I used to soak it in water, but I prefer this method because there’s no risk of watering down the flavor. You’ll slowly start to see the bulgur get plump.</li>

     <li>While the bulgur is soaking, prepare yourself for some mad chopping. Tabbouleh requires a lot of chopping – it’s really a labor of love.</li>

     <li>That includes a bunch (well, technically 2 bunches) of parsley, tomatoes, and green onions. Some people use a food processor to chop the parsley. But I find that it can sometimes lead to wilted chopped parsley. So I always use a large chef’s knife, and it does the trick.</li>

     <li>When you’re done chopping, transfer the bulgur and dressing mixture over the chopped vegetables and gently mix everything together</li>

     <li>And that’s basically the tabbouleh salad recipe! And it might be the best tabbouleh recipe you’ll ever have!</li>
