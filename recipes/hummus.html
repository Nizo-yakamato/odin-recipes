     <h2>Description :</h2>
     <p>By now, hummus has become pretty mainstream and is sold in all grocery stores. It’s essentially a Middle Eastern dip or spread that’s made by blending chickpeas, tahini (sesame paste), lemon juice, garlic, and salt. Then, it’s served with extra virgin olive oil and traditionally eaten with Arabic bread (pita). It’s a very healthy snack that you can eat as a dip or add to grain bowls, sandwiches, or salads.</p>
