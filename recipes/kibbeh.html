    <p>There are a few different types of kibbeh, and there are different ways to prepare the mixture of beef with bulgur and spices ranging from Kibbeh in Yogurt Sauce to Fried Kibbeh Balls (stuffed with ground beef and onions) to Baked Kibbeh.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
       
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Red Pepper</li>
        <li>Butter</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
      
        <li>Place the bulgur and water in a small bowl and all the bulgur to soak for 15 minutes. The water should all be absorbed. Fluff the bulgur with a fork</li>
        <li>Place the beef, red pepper, butter and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Blend until the meat forms a dough ball, stopping to scrape down the food processor as needed, about 5 minutes. Remove the mixture from the food processor and place it in a large shallow bowl in the fridge while you prepare the kamouneh mixture.</li>
        <li>In the same food processor used to make the meat paste, add the soaked bulgur, onion, kamouneh spice, basil, mint and. Blend until well combined</li>
        <li>transfer the bulgur kamouneh mixture on top of the meat paste, wet your hands with cold water and knead the kamouneh mixture into the beef until well combined. Continue to add water to your hands while kneading until everything is well combined and smooth to form the kibbeh, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the kibbeh to a serving dish and spread it out to cover the surface of the plate. You can use a knife or fork to make designs across the kibbeh.</li>
        <li>Garnish it with fresh mint, drizzle olive oil and serve with pita bread.</li>
